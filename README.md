# Grissom-Scheduler

In this scheduler, the goal was to:

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist.

# TO USE

You can input text into the appropriate time slot, which will be colored according to this legend:

GREEN: FUTURE TIME
GRAY: PAST TIME
RED: PRESENT TIME

Your  inputted tasks will save and will be ready for use.
